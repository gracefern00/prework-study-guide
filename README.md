# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This guide was created as a study guide for bootcamp students. It was built with the intention of compiling all relevant study materials in one place. It allows the materials to be clearly organized instead of scattered across multiple notes, and I learned the basics of coding throughout the process.
